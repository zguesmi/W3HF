# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```

The contract is deployed on Mumbai chain (Ploygone Testnet) at `0xf71682c7Cc551570c61b078e3DB7E02f87a24BAA`.
